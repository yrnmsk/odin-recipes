    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Use milk and cream cheese in place of eggs to make an extra-creamy carbonara.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
      <li>5 slices bacon</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes, adding peas in the last minute of cooking. Drain and keep warm in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towels, reserving 1 tablespoon of drippings in the skillet.</li>
      <li>Add garlic to the skillet; saute for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and stir in milk and cream cheese until blended.</li>
      <li>Crumble bacon and add to the linguine along with sauce and Parmesan cheese; stir to coat.</li>
    </ol>
